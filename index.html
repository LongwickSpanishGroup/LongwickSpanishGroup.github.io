            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Longwick Spanish Conversation Group is a free Spanish club where people meet in informal settings and chat in Spanish.</p>
            <p>We meet every Tuesday at the Red Lion pub in Longwick, Buckinghamshire, from 6:30 to 8:00pm.</p>
            <p>The pub is located at Thame Rd, Longwick, Princes Risborough HP27 9SG.</p>

            <p>We meet in the dining area, and although there's no requirement to buy food, the pub kindly asks that each visitor supports them by purchasing at least one drink.</p>
            <p>There's no explicit teaching involved; the idea is to try and speak about the topic we're discussion in Spanish to help unblock your conversational skills.</p>
            <p>Participation is free. However, we have a limited number of spaces available, so please don't come unannounced. Instead, please join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longwickspanishclub">Facebook group</a>, find the event for next Tuesday, and select 'Going'.</p>
            <p>If you don't have a Facebook profile but still would like to participate, please get in touch with us by email: LongwickSpanishGroup@gmail.com</p>
