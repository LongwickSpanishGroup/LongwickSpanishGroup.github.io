<p>We're often asked which online translation tools we typically use.</p>
<ol>
  <li>For a quick and rough translation that doesn't consider language nuances, use <a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=es&op=translate" target="_blank">Google Translate</a>. You can't specify whether to use formal "usted", informal "tu", or plural "vosotros" in the translation there, but it's fast and widely available.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/translator#en/es/" target="_blank">DeepL</a> seems to do a better job than Google Translate for most translation tasks, and it's also easy to use. It has both a free and a paid version. The paid version allows you to specify the level of formality and other context-related settings that can help you with the translation. However, it's a bit too expensive, and I don't think it's worth it unless you use it for business. The free version is better than Google Translate anyway. It also has Android and iOS apps.</li>
  <li>If you need a refined translation and are willing to spend some time on it, use <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>. It's not a translator, but it can translate. Please treat ChatGPT as if you're talking to a human. For example, you can say, "<i>Hi mate, could you please translate this text for me: '.....'. The context is an email to my co-workers in Argentina, so please use Argentinian Spanish and make sure the translation uses the formal 'usted' and is appropriate for office conversation.</i>" After you receive your translation, you can ask for clarification or request changes. Just pretend you're talking to a helpful friend. It's also free to use and has apps for Android/iOS.</li>
